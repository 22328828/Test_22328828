Dataset Source:
The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database.
It was downloaded in CSV format from the World Bank Data website.

1. Data Completeness:
Temporal Coverage: The dataset spans multiple decades columns from 1960 to 2023, providing a comprehensive historical view. This extensive
temporal coverage is essential for identifying long-term trends, patterns, and the impacts of various policies and interventions
on the prevalence of informal settlements.

Geographical Coverage: 
It includes data from multiple countries, allowing for comparative analysis across different regions. This is beneficial for understanding
the global context.

2. Relevance to the Theme:
Indicator Name (Column): Population living in slums (% of urban population):
This column is directly relevant as it measures the proportion of the urban population living in slum conditions. Since informal settlements are
synonymous with slums, this indicator provides a direct measure of the problem at hand. Understanding the percentage of urban populations living in 
slums helps quantify the scale of informal settlements and monitor changes over time, which is crucial for trend analysis and developing interventions.
    
Country Name:
The inclusion of this column allows the data to be filtered and analyzed by specific countries. This enables a focused analysis 
on the target region while also allowing comparisons with other countries and regions to provide context and identify best practices.

3. Credibility of the Source:
The World Bank is a reputable and credible source of global development data. Its data collection and reporting methodologies are rigorous and widely 
accepted in the academic and policy-making communities. Using data from such a credible source ensures the reliability and accuracy of the analysis.

4. Example of How the Columns Support the Theme:
By analyzing the Population living in slums (% of urban population) for Aruba, we can track how the proportion of the urban population living in 
slums has changed over time. This helps in assessing the effectiveness of past policies and identifying periods of significant change that may
correlate with socio-political or economic events.
    
Using the Country Name column, we can compare Aruba's data with that of other countries in the region (e.g., Angola, Kenya) or with regional
averages (e.g., Africa Eastern and Southern). This comparative analysis can reveal unique challenges or common issues faced by South Africa, guiding 
the development of tailored or collaborative interventions.
