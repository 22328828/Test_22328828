Algorithm: Binary Search
Time Complexity:
Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that repeatedly divides the search interval in half. The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the sorted array.

Explanation:

In each step of the algorithm, the search interval is halved, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.
Even in the worst case scenario, where the element is not present in the array, the algorithm eliminates half of the remaining elements in each iteration until it finds the target element or exhausts the search space.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity of binary search is O(1), indicating that it uses constant space.

Explanation:
Binary search does not require any additional space proportional to the size of the input array.
It only requires a few variables to keep track of the search interval and the target element, resulting in constant space complexity.
Efficiency:
Binary search is highly efficient for searching in large sorted arrays.
It significantly outperforms linear search, especially for large datasets, due to its logarithmic time complexity.
However, binary search requires the array to be sorted beforehand, which adds an extra step if the array is not already sorted.
