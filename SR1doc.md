### 1. Numerical Data
**Type**: float64, int64

**Example Columns**: "1960", "1961", ..., "2023"

**Description**: These columns represent the percentage of the urban population living in slums for each year. Numerical data is essential for various machine learning algorithms because it allows for mathematical operations and statistical analysis. 

**Usage in Machine Learning**:
- **Feature Engineering**: Numerical data can be used to create features for machine learning models. For example, the percentage of the population living in slums can be used as a feature in predictive models to forecast future trends.
- **Target Variable**: If we were predicting future percentages of the population living in slums, this column could serve as the target variable.

**Data Anomalies**:
- **Missing Values**: Missing percentages in some years.
- **Invalid Data**: Negative values or values exceeding 100% would be logically incorrect.

### 2. Categorical Data
**Type**: object

**Example Columns**: "Country Name", "Country Code", "Indicator Name", "Indicator Code"

**Description**: These columns contain categorical data, representing distinct groups or categories such as country names or codes. Categorical data is often used for classification tasks.

**Usage in Machine Learning**:
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical data is transformed into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding for use in machine learning models.
- **Grouping**: Data can be grouped by categories to compare different countries or indicators.

**Data Anomalies**:
- **Missing Values**: Missing country names or codes.
- **Duplicate Data**: Repeated entries for the same country and year.
- **Incorrect Types**: Categorical values stored as numerical values.
- **Invalid Data**: Non-existent country codes or misformatted names.

### 3. Temporal Data
**Type**: int64 (representing years)

**Example Columns**: "1960", "1961", ..., "2023"

**Description**: These columns serve as temporal data, indicating specific years. Temporal data is crucial for time series analysis, where we track how the percentage of the population living in slums changes over time.

**Usage in Machine Learning**:
- **Time Series Analysis**: Temporal data is used to analyze trends over time and forecast future values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating lagged features or rolling averages to capture temporal dependencies.

**Data Anomalies**:
- **Missing Values**: Missing years in the dataset.
- **Invalid Data**: Incorrectly formatted years or out-of-range values.

### 4. Handling Data Anomalies
In our dataset, handling these anomalies is crucial to ensure data integrity and accuracy:

- **Missing Values**: Imputation techniques such as mean, median, or using predictive models to estimate missing values.
- **Duplicate Data**: Removing duplicate entries to prevent skewing analysis.
- **Incorrect Types**: Converting data to the appropriate type (e.g., converting strings to numerical values).
- **Invalid Data**: Implementing validation rules to identify and correct or remove invalid data entries.
By addressing these anomalies, we ensure that the dataset is clean, reliable, and ready for machine learning applications.
