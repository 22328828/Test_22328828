Binary search is faster compared to linear search, linear search is slower.

Binary search is used in a sorted array or list by repeatedly dividing
the search interval in half.
• The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce
the time complexity to O(log N).
• It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or
the interval is empty.
• The search interval is halved by comparing the target element with the middle value of
the search space.


Linear search 
is defined as a
sequential search algorithm that
starts at one end and goes through
each element of a list until the
desired element is found, otherwise
the search continues till the end of
the data set.
